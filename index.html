			   <h2>What is an algorithm?<h2>
			   <p> Algorithms. We hear about them all the time. Maybe your friend tweeted "I hate insta's new algorithm!!!" or maybe you blamed not favoriting your mother's Facebook posts on the app because "the damn algorithm must've cut it out," but do you really know and understand what an algorithm is and how they operate? 
			   Most of us don't. Let's start at the beginning— Miriam Webster defines an Algorithm as "a step by step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end on a computer." 
			   The kind of algorithm we're talking about and oftentimes the one of popular discussion is that of post order on social media. 
			   The creators of social media write code for the order of posts on your timeline, newsfeed, dashboard, etc. to best suit what they've perceived as your interests. 
			   As you might guess, this can get dangerous.

			   <h2>Why would developers want to use them?</h2>
			   <p>
			   App developers have their own reasons for utilizing such algorithms based on what they believe you'll like to see. 
			   For starters, the more you like the posts you're seeing, the more likely they think you will be to return to the app.
			   In a developer's eyes, if you don'y like the content, then you don't like the app. 
			   Sometimes this is true, but sometimes it leads to you only seeing one type of post and not getting to experience it all.

			<p> Here is a graph tracking each news post I saw on Twitter, Buzzfeed, and Facebook for five days. I categorized the posts by type of news for clarification, as you can tell through my legend. 
			This begins the narrative of what posts I get to see based on each's app specific algorithms curated for my taste.

			  <h3>Twitter</h3>
			  <p>
				As you can see, my personal Twitter feed is mostly full of social and less formal news (the topics of the top half of the graph).
				Twitter's algorithm usage is very little in comparison to other apps. By way of illustration, Twitter only uses an algorithm for your posts 
				in the top 5 posts on your timeline, "In Case You Missed It" section, and the occasional tweet throughout your timeline that was posted 
				by an account you are likely to interact with. Other than these, the rest of your timeline is posted in chronological order as posts are created, 
				shared, or liked. In my case, the news I saw for the week was likely more socially based because I follow more social accounts than anything else 
				on Twitter and it is what I interact most with.
			</div>
	
			<div id="facebook">
			  <h3>Facebook</h3>
			  <p>
			  Facebook, however, presented me with more diversified news topics throughout these days. I saw posts from every category listed almost evenly. 
			  One reason this is likely is because despite the fact that Facebook's entire newsfeed is sorted in order of prevalence to you, there are options 
			  to customize your newsfeed. Users can choose to see specific posts first, hide posts and people and posts similar to them, thereby expanding their control over the newsfeed.
			  </p>
			</div>
	
	
			<div id="buzzfeed">
			  <h3>Buzzfeed</h3>
			  <p>
		       Buzzfeed is unlike most other social medias as it lacks a personalized newsfeed and instead has a homepage based on the user base as a whole's interest. There are no options to customize the homepage in any way as a user.
		        Therefore, Buzzfeed posts much more on topics like politics and entertainment that I typically would not follow or see on other social medias, as you can see in the graph.

			  <p>
			  Eli Pariser dives into the ills of algorithms in social media as of today in his Ted Talk, "Filter Bubbles." He asserts that social media networks organize your feeds to present you the most relatable posts. 
			  He then goes on to explain how only seeing posts that you can relate to is dangerous. As he argues, we begin to only see posts that align with our mentalities, therefore digging ourselves into a rabbit hole
			  of only believing and seeing one argument on important topics. He continues to say that this will lead to us being placed in a "filter bubble" where we no longer have the option of even seeing posts outside 
			  of our comfort zone. The filter bubbles begin to cater to things you find immediate interest in, perhaps things like clickbait, and no longer show you more important articles that may sit around in your 
			  reading list. While this might not seem too bad— only seeing posts we like is conceptually a good thing. That holds true until it affects our views on politics when we are no longer challenged nor see the other
			  points of view or issues that might not directly pertain to us but we should still be educated on.

			<div id="Whatcanwedo">
			  <h4>What can we do?</h4>
			  <p>
				What can we do is a hard question to tackle for this topic. First we have to want to make the changes necessary to update our feeds into  healthy, balance of post types. Users can begin by following more 
				people with opposing viewpoints, but as Pariser showed in the Ted Talk, that doesn't always work out. We must also be willing to interact with such posts and take advantage of whatever settings might be in 
				place in each app that allows for a more diverse feed. For example, that might include utilizing Facebook's options to customize your newsfeed by showing some posts first to make sure they appear on your feed.
				Another further approach is to reach out to the app developers and fight for a more equal, diversified newsfeed that shows users everything.
