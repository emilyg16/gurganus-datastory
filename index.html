			   <h2>What is an algorithm?<h2>
			   <p> Algorithms. We hear about them all the time. Maybe your friend tweeted "I hate insta's new algorithm!!!" or maybe you blamed not favoriting your mother's Facebook posts because "the damn algorithm!", but do you really know and understand what an algorithm is? 
			   Most of us don't. Let's start at the beginningâ€” Miriam Webster defines an Algorithm as "a step by step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end on a computer." 
			   The kind of algorithm we're talking about and oftentimes the one of popular discussion is that of post order on social media. 
			   The creators of social media write code for the order of posts on your timeline, newsfeed, dashboard, etc. to best suit what they've perceived as your interests. 
			   As you might guess, this can get dangerous.

			   <h2>Why would developers want to use them?</h2>
			   <p>
			   App developers have their own reasons for utilizing such algorithms based on what they believe you'll like to see. 
			   For starters, the more you like the posts you're seeing, the more likely they think you will be to return to the app.
			   In a developer's eyes, if you don'y like the content, then you don't like the app. 
			   Sometimes this is true, but sometimes it leads to you only seeing one type of post and not getting to experience it all.

			<p>Here is a graph tracking each news post I saw on Twitter, Buzzfeed, and Facebook for five days. I categorized the posts by type of news for clarification, as you can tell through my legend. 
			This begins the narrative of what posts I get to see based on each's app specific algorithms curated for my taste.

			  <h3>Twitter</h3>
			  <p>
				As you can see, my personal Twitter feed is mostly full of social and less formal news (the topics of the top half of the graph).
				Twitter's algorithm usage is very little in comparison to other apps. By way of illustration, Twitter only uses an algorithm for your posts 
				in the top 5 posts on your timeline, "In Case You Missed It" section, and the occasional tweet throughout your timeline that was posted 
				by an account you are likely to interact with. Other than these, the rest of your timeline is posted in chronological order as posts are created, 
				shared, or liked. In my case, the news I saw for the week was likely more socially based because I follow more social accounts than anything else 
				on Twitter and it is what I interact most with.
			</div>
	
			<div id="facebook">
			  <h3>Facebook</h3>
			  <p>
			  Facebook, however, presented me with more diversified news topics throughout these days. I saw posts from every category listed almost evenly. 
			  One reason this is likely is because despite the fact that Facebook's entire newsfeed is sorted in order of prevalence to you, there are options 
			  to customize your newsfeed. Users can choose to see specific posts first, hide posts and people and posts similar to them, thereby expanding their control over the newsfeed.
			  </p>

			<div id="buzzfeed">
			  <h3>Buzzfeed</h3>
			  <p>
		       Buzzfeed is unlike most other social medias as it lacks a personalized newsfeed and instead has a homepage based on the user base as a whole's interest. There are no options to customize the homepage in any way as a user.
		        Therefore, Buzzfeed posts much more on topics like politics and entertainment that I typically would not follow or see on other social medias, as you can see in the graph.
